# Grafana and Uptime-Kuma integration

This is mostly a learning project meant to help me better understand:
1. monitoring tools like uptime-kuma and grafana
2. Ansible configuration management
3. More practice with Git version control

I will deploy grafana using Ansible as much as possible. First to a local Vagrant VM, then to a 
production server. I suspect some of the final configuration I will just need to do manually.
